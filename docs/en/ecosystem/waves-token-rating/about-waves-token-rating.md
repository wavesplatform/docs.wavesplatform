# About Waves Token Rating

**Waves Token Rating** is an online service (<https://tokenrating.wavesexplorer.com>) that shows ratings of [tokens](/en/blockchain/token) (projects) issued on the Waves Platform.

User can rate any token from the web browser in which [Waves Keeper](https://docs.waves.exchange/en/waves-keeper/) is installed if there is at least 1 [WCT](/en/blockchain/token/wct) on users' address balance. The amount of WCT on the balance affects the [weight of the user's rate W<sub>n</sub>](/en/ecosystem/waves-token-rating/rating-formula).

At the time when user rates a token, he pays a [fee](/en/blockchain/transaction/transaction-fee) in [WAVES](/en/blockchain/token/waves) for the [data transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction-type/data-transaction).
