# About Waves Keeper

**Waves Keeper** is a browser extension that allows secure interaction with Waves-enabled web services.

Seed phrases and private keys are encrypted and stored within the extension and cannot be accessed by online dApps and services, making sure that users' funds are protected from hackers and malicious websites. Completion of a transaction doesn't require entering any sensitive information.

Waves Keeper is designed for convenience, so users can sign transactions with just a couple of clicks. Users can create multiple wallets and switch between them easily. And if a user ever forgets the password to the account, the access can be recovered from the seed phrase.
