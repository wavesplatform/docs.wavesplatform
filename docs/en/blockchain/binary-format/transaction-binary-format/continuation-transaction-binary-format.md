The Continuation transaction is added in node version 1.3.0 and enabled with feature #16 “Ride V5, dApp-to-dApp invocations, Continuations”. Versions 1.3.x are now available for [Stagenet](/en/blockchain/blockchain-network/) only.

Binary format is defined in [transaction.proto](https://github.com/wavesplatform/protobuf-schemas/blob/master/proto/waves/transaction.proto) protobuf scheme. The fields that are common to all types of transactions are described in the [Transaction Binary Format](/en/blockchain/binary-format/transaction-binary-format/) article.
