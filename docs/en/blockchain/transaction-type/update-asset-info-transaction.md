# Update Asset Info transaction

An **Update Asset Info transaction** — a [transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction/) that changes name and description of [asset](/en/blockchain/token/) issued before.

> The Update Asset Info transaction is added since node version 1.2.0, after activation of feature #15 “Ride V4, VRF, Protobuf, Failed transactions”. Versions 1.2.x are currently available on [Stagenet](/en/blockchain/blockchain-network/stage-network) only.

The asset name and/or description can be changed:
* on Mainnet and Testnet – after 100,000 or more blocks from the last change (or the asset issue);
* on Stagenet – after 10 or more blocks.

## Binary Format
