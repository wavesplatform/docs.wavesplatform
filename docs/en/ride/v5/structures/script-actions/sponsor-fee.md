# [Ride v5] SponsorFee

:warning: This is the documentation for the Standard Library **version 5**, which is currently available for [Stagenet](/en/blockchain/blockchain-network/) only. [Go to Mainnet version](/en/ride/structures/script-actions/sponsor-fee)

`SponsorFee` is a structure that sets up sponsorship. For information about sponsorship, see the [Sponsored Fee](/en/blockchain/waves-protocol/sponsored-fee) article. The sponsorship setup is performed only if the structure is included in the resulting expression of the callable function. See details in the [Callable Function](/en/ride/v5/functions/callable-function) article.

The sponsorship setup is only available if the asset is issued by a dApp account (by the same script invocation as well) and is not a smart asset.

## Constructor

```ride
SponsorFee(assetId: ByteVector, minSponsoredAssetFee: Int|Unit)
```

## Fields

| # | Name | Data type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | assetId | [ByteVector](/en/ride/v5/data-types/byte-vector) | Asset ID |
| 2 | minSponsoredAssetFee | [Int](/en/ride/v5/data-types/int)&#124;[Unit](/en/ride/v5/data-types/unit) | Amount of sponsored asset that is equivalent to 0.001 WAVES, specified in the minimum fraction (“cent”) of the sponsored asset.<br>`unit` — disable the sponsorship |

## Example

```
{-# STDLIB_VERSION 5 #-}
{-# CONTENT_TYPE DAPP #-}
{-# SCRIPT_TYPE ACCOUNT #-}
  
@Callable(i)
func issueAndSponsor() = {
  let issue = Issue("Spring", "", 100000, 2, true, unit, 0)
  let id = calculateAssetId(issue)
  (
    [
      issue,
      SponsorFee(id, 300)
    ],
    null
  )
}
```

The `issueAndSponsor` callable function issues an asset and enables sponsorship. The minimum fee in sponsored asset is 3 Spring.
