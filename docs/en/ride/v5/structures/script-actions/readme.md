# [Ride v5] Script actions

:warning: This is the documentation for the Standard Library **version 5**, which is currently available for [Stagenet](/en/blockchain/blockchain-network/) only. [Go to Mainnet version](/en/ride/structures/script-actions/)

Script actions are executed, that is, they make changes on the blockchain only if they are included in the resulting expression of the callable function. See more details in the [Callable function](/en/ride/v5/functions/callable-function) article.
