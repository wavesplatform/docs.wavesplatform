# dApp script

A **dApp script** — [RIDE script](/en/ride/script), that has the following directive:

```ride
{-# CONTENT_TYPE DAPP #-}
```

A dApp script can be attached to an account with a [set script transaction](/en/blockchain/transaction-type/set-script-transaction), thus creating a [dApp](/en/blockchain/account/dapp).
